# Jamar Harris's Portfolio

Hi! I'm Jamar. I am a current student at Kennesaw State University studying Software Engineering and currently in pursuit of a Bachedlor's of Sciece in the aforementioned major. Currently, I am working on developing my own art portfolio with built in e-commerce features, as well as a platforming video game hopefully to be released in the future. In my spare time I practice my programming skills with leetcode, and utilize tools like React to clone other popular websites and rebuild them from the ground up.

I have some experience utilizing different programming languages such as C++, C#, and HTML 5. HTML specifically was utilized during the early development stages of my website.
