# Jamar Harris's Portfolio

Hi! I'm Jamar. I am a current student at Kennesaw State University studying Software Engineering and currently in pursuit of a Bachedlor's of Sciece in the aforementioned major. Currently, I am working on developing my own art portfolio with built in e-commerce features, as well as a platforming video game hopefully to be released in the future. In my spare time I practice my programming skills with leetcode, and utilize tools like React to clone other popular websites and rebuild them from the ground up.

I have some experience utilizing different programming languages such as C++, C#, and HTML 5. HTML specifically was utilized during the early development stages of my website.

## Recommendation and Classification Systems using Natural Language Processing

â€¢ Collect the data: We will pick the Discourse Hub Community forums as our main data resource. You can either scrap one or several forums.

â€¢ Explore your data (EDA): After gathering our data, we will analyze it to understand the data and get familiar with it before feeding it to ML models.

â€¢ Calculate similarity between posts and recommend: We will vectorize our data, and compute the similarity matrix then use it to recommend posts similar to a certain post.

â€¢  Train ML classifiers and classify a post into its appropriate category.

â€¢  Compare and choose the best approach: evaluate the results of step 3 and 4 and choose the best one.

â€¢  Build a simple web app using Flask or Streamlit.

â€¢ Deploy your web app using AWS or Heroku or some other service.

## Loki Title Sequence Recreation
â€¢ Program was created to cycle through random numbers associated with fonts scrapped from Dafont.com to be used in a short animation

â€¢ Web scraping tool Octoparse was utilized to scrape data from Dafont.com 

â€¢ Fonts from Dafont were then stored in a excel file and associated with a number 1-20 and randomly generated with a c++ program to be utilized for every letter in a key frame

* All key frames cycle through fonts chosen by the aforementioned c++ program which ran nine consecutive times, one for each letter
